Let's look at an (grand) analogy:
The economy

Slide 3
Every company needs to keep their own accounting. Keeping track of documents, tax payments, tax deductions and laws determines the stability of the company.

Slide 6
What if you move the accounting from companies and into the state system and all financial transactions would be transparent instantly?

Slide 7
Companies would focus only on their main objective and not worry a bit about the paper work. The state would have an 100% up-to-date view of the economy at a millisecond level and never worry about syncing with the companies.

Slide 8
Application state is exactly the same - if each component keeps state it just like a company burdened with accounting. When you're trying to keep a myriad of components in sync, you feel like an exhausted clerk from a financial bureau.
