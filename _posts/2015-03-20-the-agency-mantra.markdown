A while ago I came up with a mantra which summarises the important procedures in a Digital Agency. Take the time and think what processes bring the most value to you and your company. Make them understandable and enjoyable for anyone working or collaborating with you.

Here’s my take on the Agency Mantra:

- If it’s not in Jira, I won’t do it
- If it’s not on Google Drive, I won’t use it
- If I don’t understand it, I won’t estimate it
- If my manager doesn’t know about it, it’s not a priority
- If it’s not planned, I won’t execute it
- If it’s not clear feedback, I won’t redo my work
- If it doesn’t have a due date, I won’t plan it
- If I don’t know the why and the what, I won’t manage it
- If I am not responsible for it, I won’t manage it
- If it’s not finished, I won’t test it
- If I can’t budget it, I don’t need it
- If it can’t fit the budget, I don’t need it
