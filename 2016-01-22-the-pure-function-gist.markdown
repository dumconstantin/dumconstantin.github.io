The pure function gist

*The Pure function* is the essence of functional programming. Get this and everything else will just flow.

This is the first of a (hopefully) series of "gists" on programming paradigms.
These are not tutorials but I will provide a list of further reading at the end of the article.

My intent is the raw insight, the emotional reaction that floods your body with sheer joy and makes you jump from your chair and exclaim "Wow! This is it! It's incredible! I finally got it!".
The knowledge part will then be up to you: tutorials, books, whatever - they'll come easy, you won't need the details, all you'll care about is the meat, the substance of insight. You save valuable time and find new ways be motivated, to improve productivity and be pasionate, even evangelic, of your profession.

*Important* you really need to lower your guard here, the aim is to change something inside you and you might initilly reject or
feel daunted by these ideas. Its normal. New things can be scary but don't allow that to intimidate you. You'll come out on the other side more powerfull than you ever been.

*So we begin...*

You see and interact with the patterns of your world daily. The small stuff like opening a door or pouring coffe into a mug are mostly unconscious and are done roughly the same by everyone else on the planet. Pressing keys on a keyboard (if you learned touch typing) became seamless to you - you think of a word and the fingers find their way to every letter. Doing things unconscious frees your time and energy to focus on other stuff, maybe more important stuff.

As a child you were in a huge rush to automate your body: walking, pronunciation, lifting a spoon and taking it to your mouth, this kind of things. You enjoyed the learning and funny moments but the goal (or the result) was your ability to interact with intent. You needed something moved? Done, your body knew how. You wanted someone to give you a cookie? Done, the lungs, glottis, larynx, tongue, lips and jaw harmoniously moved (as any other person would) to produce speech.

You automate things, that's what humans do but once automated you no longer need to keep it in your head, you just need to know the command to give. That's how you interact with your world, you declare something and it gets done. How? Doesn't really matter, the important thing is that it gets done.

Everyone does things similarly so you could just as well define a language for how a human operated: move! breathe! chew Y! say my name! type zzzz! pay XYZ! read this! etc. Yup, humans are that versatile.

*Stop right here!* Breathe, things will swirl a bit out of control and then come again smooth.

Say the following word out loud: "mayacumba" (it doesn't mean anything), but say it, really. Involve your body in this article. Did you say it?
Did you notice how it was silence, then you spoke, then it was silence again? Speech arises out of silence and returns into silence, there is not trail left behind.

Lets do it again but this time clap once. Your hands together. Did you clap?
The same thing happened with the sound - it came from nowhere and then dissapeared - but your hands held the sensation of impact for a few seconds and then it faded.
